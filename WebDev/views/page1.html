            Neco-Arc (ネコアルク, Neko-Aruku?) is a Neco Spirit appearing in the Tsukihime series. She is a pint-sized cat girl parody
            of Arcueid Brunestud, acting as the mascot character of Type-Moon at times. In Fate/Grand Carnival, she appears as Mysterious Neco X (謎のネコX, Nazo no Neko X?), parodying Mysterious Heroine X/Artoria Pendragon. Background
            Neco-Arc is a member of the Neco Spirit race, originating from the Great Cat's Village.[2] She became Ms. Ciel's student, constantly acting up in retaliation for having such little screen time and wishing people
             to think she is smart.[3] She is referred to as the "work of Kischur Zelretch Schweinorg" according to Aoko Aozaki, suggesting she was brought from another world, but it's also said that there is a "certain urban legend"
            telling of six Neco-Arcs and one that exceeds them that could be a materialization of TATARI.[4]
            Other Neco-Arcs include Neco-Arc 
            Bubbles, Neco-Arc Chaos, Neco-Arc Destiny, Neco-Arc Evolution, and Mysterious Neco Z. Personality
            Neco-Arc is known as the biggest small-fry in the Cat Kingdom.[3] Most characters are unnerved by her appearance, and she especially torments White Len, calling her a
            "tsundere", and Satsuki Yumizuka, who Neco-Arc constantly reminds that she doesn't have a major role in Tsukihime. She recognizes Miyako Arima as a much-awaited future rival.[5]
